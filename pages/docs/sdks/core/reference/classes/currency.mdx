# Currency

The `Currency` type represents any fungible financial instrument that can be used within the Razor DEX ecosystem. 
It serves as a union type of two specific currency implementations: `NativeCurrency` and `Token`.

## Overview

In the Razor DEX SDK, currencies are categorized into two main types:

1. **Native Currencies**: Chain-native currencies like MOVE.
2. **Tokens**: FA or similar token standards that exist on a blockchain.

The `Currency` type allows functions and components to accept either type of currency as input, providing flexibility in the SDK's design.

## Type Definition

```typescript
export type Currency = NativeCurrency | Token
```

## Properties

All Currency implementations (both `NativeCurrency` and `Token`) inherit from `BaseCurrency` and include the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `chainId` | `number` | The chain ID on which this currency resides |
| `decimals` | `number` | The decimals used in representing currency amounts |
| `symbol` | `string` | The symbol of the currency (e.g., "MOVE", "USDC") |
| `name` | `string \| undefined` | The name of the currency (e.g., "Move Coin", "USD Coin") |
| `isNative` | `boolean` | Whether the currency is native to the chain |
| `isToken` | `boolean` | Whether the currency is a token (non-native) |

## Methods

All Currency implementations provide these methods:

| Method | Return Type | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `equals(other: Currency)` | `boolean` | Returns whether this currency is functionally equivalent to another currency |
| `wrapped` | `Token` | Returns the wrapped version of this currency that can be used with DEX contracts |

## Usage Examples

### Working with a Currency

```typescript
function handleCurrency(currency: Currency) {
  if (currency.isNative) {
    // Handle native currency
    console.log(`Native currency: ${currency.symbol}`);
  } else {
    // Handle token
    console.log(`Token: ${currency.symbol} at address ${currency.address}`);
  }
  
  // Properties available on all currencies
  console.log(`Chain ID: ${currency.chainId}`);
  console.log(`Decimals: ${currency.decimals}`);
}
```

### Type Narrowing

TypeScript can narrow the Currency type based on the `isNative` or `isToken` properties:

```typescript
function getAddress(currency: Currency): string {
  if (currency.isToken) {
    return currency.address; // TypeScript knows this is a Token
  }
  throw new Error("Native currencies don't have addresses");
}
```
