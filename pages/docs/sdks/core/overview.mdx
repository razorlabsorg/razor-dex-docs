# The Razor DEX Core SDK

The Razor DEX Core SDK provides abstractions for other SDKs to use in a Typescript/Javascript environment. It is used throughout all Razor DEX SDKs, such as the [AMM SDK](../amm/overview.md).

This SDK is not expected to be used in isolation, but only as part of other SDKs.

We recommend taking a look at the [**Technical Reference**](./reference/overview).
