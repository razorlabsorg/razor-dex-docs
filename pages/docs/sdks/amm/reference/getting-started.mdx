# Getting Started

The pages that follow contain technical reference information on the Razor DEX AMM SDK.
Looking for a [quick start](/docs/sdks/amm/guides/quick-start) instead?
You may also want to jump into a [guide](/docs/sdks/amm/guides/fetching-data),
which offers a friendlier introduction to the SDK!

The SDK is written in TypeScript, has a robust test suite, performs arbitrary precision arithmetic,
and supports rounding to significant digits or fixed decimal places.
The principal exports of the SDK are _entities_: classes that contain initialization and validation checks,
necessary data fields, and helper functions.

An important concept in the SDK is _fractions_. Because Move performs integer math, care must be taken in
non-MoveVM environments to faithfully replicate the actual computation carried out on-chain.
The first concern here is to ensure that an overflow-safe integer implementation is used.

The second concern is precision loss due to, for example, chained price ratio calculations.
To address this issue, all math operations are performed as fraction operations, ensuring arbitrary precision up
until the point that values are rounded for display purposes, or truncated to fit inside a fixed bit width.

The Fractions class, among others that the AMM SDK depends on, are exported from the SDK Core to allow interoperability with the CLAMM SDK(When it is ready). 
Refer to the [Core SDK section of the docs](/docs/sdks/core/overview) to learn more about these classes.

The SDK works for all Move chains on which the [factory](docs/contracts/amm/reference/smart-contracts/factory#address) is deployed.

## Code

The [source code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/razorlabsorg/razor-dex-sdk/blob/master/packages/amm-sdk).

## Dependencies

The SDK installs a small number of dependencies(https://github.com/razorlabsorg/razor-dex-sdk/blob/master/packages/amm-sdk/package.json#L24).
