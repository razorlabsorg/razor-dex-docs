# Fetching Data

> Looking for a [quickstart](/docs/sdks/amm/guides/quick-start)?

While the SDK is fully self-contained, there are two cases where it needs _on-chain data_ to function.
This guide will detail both of these cases, and offer a sample that you can use to fetch this data.

# Case 1: Tokens

Unsurprisingly, the SDK needs some notion of a fungible token to be able to function. This immediately 
raises the question of _where data about tokens comes from_.

As an example, let's try to represent USDT in a format the SDK can work with. To do so, we need at 
least 3 pieces of data: a **chainId**, a **token address**, and how many **decimals** the token has. 
We also may be interested in the **symbol** and/or **name** of the token.

## Identifying Data

The first two pieces of data — **chainId** and **token address** — must be provided by us. Thinking 
about it, this makes sense, as there's really no other way to unambiguously identify a token.

So, in the case of USDT, we know that the **chainId** is `126` (we're on mainnet), and the **token address** 
is `0xe5df458e0bb7020247d5e8c4f5fda70adaccff5318bb456bad8f7c1e3d2bf744`. Note that it's very important 
to externally verify token addresses. Don't use addresses from sources you don't trust!

## Required Data

The next piece of data we need is **decimals**.

### Provided by the User

One option here is to simply pass in the correct value, which we may know is `6`. At this point, 
we're ready to represent USDT as a [Token](/docs/sdks/core/reference/classes/token):

```tsx twoslash
import { ChainId, Token } from '@razorlabs/swap-sdk-core'

const chainId = ChainId.MAINNET
const tokenAddress = '0xe5df458e0bb7020247d5e8c4f5fda70adaccff5318bb456bad8f7c1e3d2bf744'
const decimals = 6
const symbol = 'tUSDT'

const DAI = new Token(chainId, tokenAddress, decimals, symbol)
```

If we don't know or don't want to hardcode the value, we could look it up ourselves via any method 
of retrieving on-chain data in a function that looks something like:

```tsx twoslash
import { ChainId } from '@razorlabs/swap-sdk-core'
import { Aptos, AptosConfig } from '@aptos-labs/ts-sdk'

export function getNetworkRPCUrl(chainId: ChainId) {
  switch (chainId) {
    case ChainId.BARDOCK_TESTNET:
      return 'https://aptos.testnet.bardock.movementlabs.xyz/v1'
    default:
      return 'https://mainnet.movementnetwork.xyz/v1'
  }
}

export function getNetworkIndexerUrl(chainId: ChainId) {
  switch (chainId) {
    case ChainId.BARDOCK_TESTNET:
      return 'https://indexer.mainnet.movementnetwork.xyz/v1/graphql'
    default:
      return 'https://indexer.testnet.movementnetwork.xyz/v1/graphql'
  }
}

export function getDefaultProvider(chainId: ChainId) {
  const config = new AptosConfig({
    fullnode: getNetworkRPCUrl(chainId),
    indexer: getNetworkIndexerUrl(chainId),
  })
  const provider = new Aptos(config)
  return provider
}

async function getDecimals(chainId: ChainId, address: string): Promise<number> {
  const provider = getDefaultProvider(chainId).fungibleAsset;
  const tokenMetadata = await provider.getFungibleAssetMetadataByAssetType({ 
    assetType: address 
  });
  return tokenMetadata.decimals
}
```

## Optional Data

Finally, we can talk about **projectLink** and **name**. Because these fields aren't used anywhere 
in the SDK itself, they're optional, and can be provided if you want to use them in your application. 
However, the SDK will not fetch them for you, so you'll have to provide them:

```tsx twoslash
import { ChainId, Token } from '@razorlabs/swap-sdk-core'

const USDT = new Token(
  ChainId.MAINNET, 
  '0xe5df458e0bb7020247d5e8c4f5fda70adaccff5318bb456bad8f7c1e3d2bf744', 
  6, 
  'tUSDT', 
  'Tether USD',
  'https://tether.to'
)
```


# Case 2: Pairs

Now that we've explored how to define a token, let's talk about pairs. To read more about what 
Razor DEX pairs are, see [Pair](/docs/contracts/amm/reference/smart-contracts/pair)

As an example, let's try to represent the DAI-MOVE pair.

## Identifying Data

Each pair consists of two tokens (see previous section).

## Required Data

The data we need is the _reserves_ of the pair. To read more about reserves, see [getReserves](/docs/contracts/amm/reference/smart-contracts/pair#getreserves).

### Provided by the User

One option here is to simply pass in values which we've fetched ourselves to create a [Pair](/docs/sdks/amm/reference/pair). 
In this example we use ethers to fetch the data directly from the blockchain:

```tsx twoslash
import { ChainId, Token, CurrencyAmount } from '@razorlabs/swap-sdk-core'
import { Pair, WMOVE } from '@razorlabs/amm-sdk'

const DAI = new Token(ChainId.MAINNET, '0xfdae7b1bf4b0009f2373ff9e2a636f04bcc8b2d82563de84f4b511f19278c417', 6, 'tDAI')

function createPair(): Pair {
  const tokens = [DAI, WMOVE[ChainId.MAINNET]]
  const [token0, token1] = tokens[0].sortsBefore(tokens[1]) ? tokens : [tokens[1], tokens[0]]
  const currencyAmount0 = CurrencyAmount.fromRawAmount(token0, 100000)
  const currencyAmount1 = CurrencyAmount.fromRawAmount(token1, 109)

  const pair = new Pair(currencyAmount0, currencyAmount1)
  return pair
}
```

Note that these values can change as frequently as every block, and should be kept up-to-date.
