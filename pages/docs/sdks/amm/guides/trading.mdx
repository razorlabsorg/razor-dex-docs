# Trading

> Looking for a [quickstart](/docs/sdks/amm/guides/quick-start)?

The SDK _cannot execute trades or send transactions on your behalf_. Rather, it offers utility 
classes and functions which make it easy to calculate the data required to safely interact with 
Razor DEX. Nearly everything you need to safely transact with Razor DEX is provided by the 
[Trade](/docs/sdks/amm/reference/trade) entity. However, it is your responsibility to use this data 
to send transactions in whatever context makes sense for your application.

This guide will focus exclusively on sending a transaction to the [Razor DEX AMM router](/docs/contracts/amm/reference/smart-contracts/router)

# Sending a Transaction to the Router

Let's say we want to trade 1 MOVE for as much DAI as possible:

```tsx twoslash
import { ChainId, Token, CurrencyAmount, TradeType } from '@razorlabs/swap-sdk-core'
import { Trade, Route, WMOVE, Pair } from '@razorlabs/amm-sdk'

const DAI = new Token(ChainId.MAINNET, '0xfdae7b1bf4b0009f2373ff9e2a636f04bcc8b2d82563de84f4b511f19278c417', 6, 'tDAI')

const currencyAmountA = CurrencyAmount.fromRawAmount(DAI, 1000)
const currencyAmountB = CurrencyAmount.fromRawAmount(WMOVE[ChainId.MAINNET], 1000)

// To learn how to get Pair data, refer to the previous guide.
const pair = new Pair(currencyAmountA, currencyAmountB)

const route = new Route([pair], WMOVE[ChainId.MAINNET], DAI)

const amountIn = '1000000000000000000' //

const trade = new Trade(route, CurrencyAmount.fromRawAmount(WMOVE[ChainId.MAINNET], amountIn), TradeType.EXACT_INPUT)
```

So, we've constructed a trade entity, but how do we use it to actually send a transaction? There are 
still a few pieces we need to put in place.

The first step is selecting the appropriate router function. The names of router functions are intended 
to be self-explanatory; in this case we want [swap_exact_move_for_tokens](docs/contracts/amm/reference/smart-contracts/router#swapexactmovefortokens), 
because we're swapping an exact amount of MOVE for tokens.

That Move interface for this function is:

```move
public entry fun swap_exact_move_for_tokens(
  sender: &signer,
  amount_move: u64,
  amount_out_min: u64,
  path: vector<address>,
  to: address,
  deadline: u64,
) {
  // implementation
}
```

Jumping back to our trading code, we can construct all the necessary parameters:

```tsx twoslash
import { Percent, ChainId, Token, CurrencyAmount, TradeType } from '@razorlabs/swap-sdk-core'
import { WMOVE, Trade, Pair, Route } from '@razorlabs/amm-sdk'

const slippageTolerance = new Percent('50', '10000') // 50 bips, or 0.50%

const DAI = new Token(ChainId.MAINNET, '0xfdae7b1bf4b0009f2373ff9e2a636f04bcc8b2d82563de84f4b511f19278c417', 6, 'tDAI')
const currencyAmountA = CurrencyAmount.fromRawAmount(DAI, 1000)
const currencyAmountB = CurrencyAmount.fromRawAmount(WMOVE[ChainId.MAINNET], 1000)

// To learn how to get Pair data, refer to the previous guide.
const pair = new Pair(currencyAmountA, currencyAmountB)

const route = new Route([pair], WMOVE[ChainId.MAINNET], DAI)

const amountIn = '1000000000000000000' //

const trade = new Trade(route, CurrencyAmount.fromRawAmount(WMOVE[ChainId.MAINNET], amountIn), TradeType.EXACT_INPUT)

const amountOutMin = trade.minimumAmountOut(slippageTolerance).toExact() // needs to be converted to e.g. decimal string
const path = [WMOVE[ChainId.MAINNET].address, DAI.address]
const to = '' // should be a recipient address
const deadline = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 60 * 20 // 20 minutes from the current Unix time
const value = trade.inputAmount.toExact() // // needs to be converted to e.g. decimal string
```

The slippage tolerance encodes _how large of a price movement we're willing to tolerate before our 
trade will fail to execute_. We use this slippage tolerance to calculate the _minimum_ amount of DAI 
we must receive before our trade reverts, thanks to [minimumAmountOut](/docs/sdks/amm/reference/trade#minimumamountout). 
Note that this code calculates this worst-case outcome _assuming that the current price, i.e the 
route's mid price,_ is fair (usually a good assumption because of arbitrage).

The path is simply the ordered list of token addresses we're trading through, in our case MOVE and 
DAI

The to address is the address that will receive the DAI.

The deadline is the Unix timestamp after which the transaction will fail, to protect us in the case 
that our transaction takes a long time to confirm and we wish to rescind our trade.

The value is the amount of MOVE that must be included as the `amount_move` in our transaction.
