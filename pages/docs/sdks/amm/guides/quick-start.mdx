# AMM SDK Quick start

The AMM SDK exists to help developers build on top of Razor DEX. It's designed to run in any 
environment that can execute JavaScript (think websites, node scripts, etc.). While simple enough 
to use in a hackathon project, it's also robust enough to power production applications.

## Installation

:::code-group
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @razorlabs/amm-sdk
```

```bash [npm]
npm install @razorlabs/amm-sdk
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @razorlabs/amm-sdk
```

```bash [bun]
bun add @razorlabs/amm-sdk
```

# Usage

To run code from the SDK in your application, use an `import` or `require` statement, 
depending on which your environment supports. Note that the guides following this page will 
use ES6 syntax.

## ES6 (import)

```tsx twoslash
import { ChainId } from '@razorlabs/swap-sdk-core'
import { Pair } from '@razorlabs/amm-sdk'
console.log(`The chainId of mainnet is ${ChainId.MAINNET}.`)
```

## CommonJS (require)

```tsx
const CORE = require('@razorlabs/swap-sdk-core')
const AMM_SDK = require('@razorlabs/amm-sdk')
console.log(`The chainId of mainnet is ${CORE.ChainId.MAINNET}.`)
```

# Reference

Comprehensive reference material for the SDK is publicly available on the 
[Razor Labs Github](https://github.com/razorlabsorg).
