## Introduction

The Razor DEX protocol is a peer-to-peer system designed for exchanging tokens on the [Movement](https://movementnetwork.xyz/) blockchain.
The protocol is implemented as a set of smart contracts; designed to prioritize censorship resistance, security, self-custody, and to function
without any trusted intermediaries who may selectively restrict access.

## How does Razor DEX compare to a typical market?

To understand how the Razor DEX protocol differs from a traditional exchange, it is helpful to first 
look at two subjects: how the Automated Market Maker design deviates from traditional central limit 
order book-based exchanges, and how permissionless systems depart from conventional permissioned systems.

### Order Book VS AMM

Most publicly accessible markets use a central limit [order book](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/order-book.asp) 
style of exchange, where buyers and sellers create orders organized by price level that are progressively 
filled as demand shifts. Anyone who has traded stocks through brokerage firms will be familiar with an 
order book system.

Razor DEX uses an Automated Market Maker (AMM), sometimes referred to as a Constant Function Market Maker, 
in place of an order book.

At a very high level, an AMM replaces the buy and sell orders in an order book market with a liquidity 
pool of two assets, both valued relative to each other. As one asset is traded for the other, the relative 
prices of the two assets shift, and a new market rate for both is determined. In this dynamic, a buyer 
or seller trades directly with the pool, rather than with specific orders left by other parties. 

### Permissionless Systems

The second departure from traditional markets is the permissionless and immutable design of the 
Razor DEX protocol. Permissionless design means that the protocol's services are entirely open for public use, 
with no ability to selectively restrict who can or cannot use them. Anyone can swap, provide liquidity, 
or create new markets at will. This is a departure from traditional financial services, which typically 
restrict access based on geography, wealth status, and age.
