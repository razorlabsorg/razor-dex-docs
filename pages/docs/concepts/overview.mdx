## Protocol, Interface, Labs

To begin, we should make clear the distinctions between the different areas of "Razor DEX", some of which may confuse new users.

- **[Razor Labs](https://github.com/razorlabsorg)**: The company which developed the Razor DEX protocol, along with the web interface.
- **[Razor DEX Protocol](https://github.com/razorlabsorg/contracts)**: A suite of smart contracts that together create an automated market maker, a protocol that facilitates peer-to-peer market making and swapping of tokens on the Movement blockchain.
- **[Razor DEX Interface](https://app.razordex.xyz/)**: A web interface that allows for easy interaction with the Razor DEX protocol. The interface is only one of many ways one may interact with the Razor DEX protocol.
