## Introduction

Swaps are the most common way of interacting with Razor DEX. For end-users, swapping is straightforward: 
a user selects a token that they own and a token they would like to trade it for. Executing a swap sells 
the currently owned tokens for the proportional[^1] amount of the tokens desired, minus the swap fee, which 
is awarded to liquidity providers[^2]. Swapping with Razor DEX is a permissionless process.

Swaps using Razor DEX are different from traditional order book trades in that they are not executed 
against discrete orders on a first-in-first-out basis â€” rather, swaps execute against a passive pool 
of liquidity, with liquidity providers earning fees proportional to their capital committed

## Price Impact

In a traditional order-book market, a sizeable market-buy order may deplete the available liquidity of 
a prior limit-sell and continue to execute against a subsequent limit-sell order at a higher price. 
The result is the final execution price of the order is somewhere in between the two limit-sell prices 
against which the order was filled.

Price impact affects the execution price of a swap similarly but is a result of a different dynamic. 
When using an automated market maker, the relative value of one asset in terms of the other continuously 
shifts during the execution of a swap, leaving the final execution price somewhere between where the 
relative price started - and ended.

This dynamic affects every swap using Razor DEX, as it is an inextricable part of AMM design.
As the amount of liquidity available at different price points can vary, the price impact for a given 
swap size will change relative to the amount of liquidity available at any given point in price space. 
The greater the liquidity available at a given price, the lower the price impact for a given swap size. 
The lesser the liquidity available, the higher the price impact.

Approximate[^3] price impact is anticipated in real-time via the Razor DEX interface, and warnings appear if unusually high price impact will occur during a swap. Anyone executing a swap will have the ability to assess the circumstances of price impact when needed.

## Slippage

The other relevant detail to consider when approaching swaps with Razor DEX is slippage. Slippage is 
the term we use to describe alterations to a given price that could occur before a submitted transaction 
is confirmed.

Slippage tolerances establish a margin of change acceptable to the user beyond price impact. As long as 
the execution price is within the slippage range, e.g., %1, the transaction will be executed. If the 
execution price ends up outside of the accepted slippage range, the transaction will fail, and the 
swap will not occur.

A comparable situation in a traditional market would be a market-buy order executed after a delay. One 
can know the expected price of a market-buy order when submitted, but much can change in the time 
between submission and execution.

## Safety Checks

Price impact and slippage can both change while a transaction is being executed, which is why we have 
built numerous safety checks into Razor DEX to protect end-users from drastic changes in the execution 
environment of their swap. Some of the most commonly encountered safety checks:

- **Expired** : A transaction error that occurs if a swap is pending longer than a predetermined 
deadline. The deadline is a point in time after which the swap will be canceled to protect against 
unusually long pending periods and the changes in price that typically accompany the passage of time.

- **INSUFFICIENT_OUTPUT_AMOUNT** : When a user submits a swap, the Razor DEX interface will send an 
estimate of how much of the purchased token the user should expect to receive. If the anticipated 
output amount of a swap does not match the estimate within a certain margin of error (the slippage 
tolerance), the swap will be canceled. This attempts to protect the user from any drastic and 
unfavorable price changes while their transaction is pending.

one token in terms of the other, slippage, price impact, and other factors related to the open and 
adversarial nature of blockchain networks.
